# Install

Assuming youâ€™ve already installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and ([Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or
[GraalVM](http://www.graalvm.org/)), optionally install the project management utilities development tool.

## Using NPM

```bash
npm install -g @es4x/create # OR yarn global add @es4x/create
```

The package will install a `es4x` command globally that can be used to create projects and perform other tasks. To know
more about the tool:

```bash
es4x --help
```

### Using NPX

The same package can be used as a one-shot operation with `npx`. In this case refer to it as:

```bash
npx @es4x/create --help
```

## OS package

When working on CI environments where the amount of packages is limited, the package manager can be installed by
unzipping the prepackaged tar/zip file.

```bash
ES4X='0.9.0' \
  curl -sL \
  https://github.com/reactiverse/es4x/releases/download/$ES4X/es4x-pm-$ES4X-bin.tar.gz \
  | tar zx --strip-components=1 -C /usr/local
```

For Windows Operating Systems the same can be done using a `zip` file instead.

::: tip
Using `npm` should be the preferred way to install as it allows easy upgrades and should be portable across different
*Operating Systems*.

## Verify the installation

You should now have a `es4x` command available in your path, you can test it by running:

using Java < 11 will run on `Interpreted` mode which is not performance or recommended for production.
